#Online Balloon Shop
##Made by Nikola Stanojkovski

An online balloon shop application for buying a new balloon and listing out the orders available in the appropriate shopping cart. 

There is a Spring Security authentication using a Custom Authentication Provider, and a multi-layered architecture with repository, service, domain and web layer on the back-end. On the front end, thymeleaf templates are used.

There are two main roles in the application: 'User' and 'Admin'.

Users with the role 'Admin' have additional rights to add, edit and delete balloons from the shop.
